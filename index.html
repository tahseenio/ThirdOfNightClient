          It was narrated from Ibn ‘Abbaas that a caller calls from heaven every
          night during the time before dawn (saying): Who will ask so that he
          may be given? Who will call so that he may be answered? Who will seek
          forgiveness so that he may be forgiven? And everyone between heaven
          and earth hears it except jinn and humans. Do you not see how the
          rooster and other creatures like him call out at that time?

        The calculated times displayed above are accurate to the nearest minute.
        In your case, this means if you pray or make dua at least 1 minute after
        <span class="userthird"></span>, this means you have definitely prayed
        or made dua in the last third of the night. Click
        <a
          href="https://islamqa.info/en/answers/291824/the-virtue-of-offering-supplication-in-the-last-third-of-the-night"
          >here</a
        >
        to understand why the last third of the night is a special time for
        Muslims. As for the midnight value given to you (<span
          class="usermidnight"
        ></span
        >), this is for those who believe the ‘Isha prayer must be performed
        before midnight. This is also accurate to the nearest minute, so this
        could mean midnight is actually 1 minute earlier than the value given to
        you. I must remind you that the calculator depends on you giving
        accurate times for Maghrib and Fajr, so you must ensure they are
        correct. Report issues to me on
